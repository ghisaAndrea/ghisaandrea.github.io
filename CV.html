				<h2>Travelling</h2>
				<p>One of my passions is travelling. I had a great opportunity in high school to see many countries, such Italy, Germany, Austria, France.				
				</p>

				<h2>Reading</h2>
				<p>Reading is a wonderful way to forget about your daily worries, relax. I love to curl up with a book at the end of the day for 30 minutes just prior to going to sleep.
				It's one of my favourite ways to de-stress and let go prior to falling to sleep.</p>

				<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>I think participating in team sports help develop good character. When I was in high school I played handball for three years. That
					experience helped me to become a good team player. In the summer I like swimming and having a sunbath.
					Snowboarding is my favourite sport because I like fresh air, this allows me to appreciate nature and to feel free. </p>
