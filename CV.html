				<h2>Reading</h2>
				<p>Besides playing with my animals (I have 3 dogs and 2 cats) I think reading is a wonderful way to forget about worries and relax. I love to curl up with a book, at the end of the day, for at least 30 minutes.</p>

				<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>I think that participating in team sports helps developing a good character. When I was in high school I played handball for three years. That
					experience helped me to become a good team player. During summer I like the sunbaths and to go swimming.
					Snowboarding is my favourite sport because I like fresh air. This allows me to appreciate nature and to feel free. </p>
